![Error]()
> An Error occurred that kept me from completing the project. 

> I kept trying to fix it but couldn't figure out a way around this error.
> The error seems to have to do with the difference between standalone and not standalone projects but I can't get it to work either way.
> I do understand what is supposed to happen and what is supposed to display.
> The program is meant to display a component as part of the the main page that sends a message to the console displaying the entered name.
> The info component is meant to send the information of the selected product to the console as well.

### Research

> The @Input decorator can receive information from a parent component. In this case, it receives the information about the product.

> The [value] html tag defines the initial value of the options. In this case, it displays the selected product.

> The [(ngModel)] tag references a product model to use when fetching information about the product.
