### Research

---

> This starter react project uses javascript, html, and JSX to build a single-page application. The application displays information cards for different albums through the use of interconnecting components dispayed on index.html.

> The cards are now now rendered horizontally, though I don't know why the images didn't appear.

---

### Research

---

> The app now features the use of map to return an appropriate card for each album in an array. The app also not only makes use of props, but also states.
