> I encountered an error at the end of this activity when trying to fetch data from the MySQL database. I'm not sure what caused it.

### Research

> The app now contains a search form that allows the user to search for an album by description. It sends the searchPhrase to the console and updates the displayed albums upon submit. The application now obtains information from a database (or at least it's supposed to).

### Research

> This app demonstrates how routes work in React apps. The app uses hooks like useLocation and useNavigate to keep track of states like location and navigation. It also demonstrates the use of privateRoutes which check for authorization before allowing a user to acces a route.

## Part 4: Navigation Routing

### Screenshots

![Updated Main Page](https://github.com/ScribeEzra/CST-391/blob/main/Media/Activity%206/11.png)

> The Updated Main Page Of The Music App

![New Album Page](https://github.com/ScribeEzra/CST-391/blob/main/Media/Activity%206/12.png)

> The New Album Page Of The Music App

![Search Results](https://github.com/ScribeEzra/CST-391/blob/main/Media/Activity%206/13.png)

> The search results of the music app still doesn't display any albums. My guess is there is an issue with the connection to the database.

### Research

> Taking from the mini app exercise, the music app now uses hooks such as useLocation and useNavigate to keep track of states. It doesn't use privateRoutes yet but it does make use of routes to link to the main page and the new album page.
