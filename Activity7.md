## Part 6: Create New Album
### Screenshots

> The Beginnings Of The Create Album Form Page

![Formatted Form Page]()

> The Create Album Page Formatted To Accept Input To Create A New Album (onSubmit Does Not Work Yet)

![App Successfully Reading Data]()

> I Finally Got The App To Read The Data- It Was A Typo That I Finally Noticed. I Had Typed baseUrl Instead Of baseURL.

### Research

> The app now has a form page that allows for the creation of a new album. It accepts all of the necesary data except for tracks. Tracks would be added a different way in an optional challenge that I didn't have time to complete. The onSubmit doesn't work yet and I can't figure out why, although I suspect a typo somewhere as that was what was preventing the app from fetching data.

## Part 7: Edit an Album

### Screenshots

![EditAlbum Form]()

> EditAlbum Form Added To App

![Album Details]()

> Album Details Page Added To App

### Research

> The NewAlbum form has been changed to an EditAlbum Form. It uses a variable newAlbumCreation to keep track of whether the album will be post or put into the database. The submit still doesn't work at this point. The Album Details page does display album information but is not fully functional.
